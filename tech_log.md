Day 1
Created tech_log.md in VS Code.
Learning how files and folders work. took a while to undertand. 
Still setting everything up.

Goal for tomorrow:
Build first HTML page.
one thing that felt good. getting set up. 
one thing that confused me was how the sytems worked and creating a file and folder needed to be done a specific way and adding it to github through creating a repo.

Day 2: created style.css and linked it to index.html, learned how HTML connects to css, changed background color, text color and fonts, uploaded updated files to GitHub and committed changes. 
understanding still basic - brackets/tags not fully clear yet. But workflow improving and getting comfortable using VS code and GitHub. Goal for tomorrow: style individual elements (headings, list, etc).
one thing that felt good, fixing the error in the index where i wrote csss instead of css, then everything started to work smoothly.
nothing cofusing about today. 

Day 3: Reviewed HTML and CSS structure, starting layout and spacing control today.
Began understanding padding vs width constraints. commited updates to GitHub. 
one thing that felt good  was understanding HTML structure to the point where i independently added in a h2 and applied CSS. However what i learned was 'the last rule wins'. this meant i tried to style two h2's under different colors. was not possible. Also  about learned UI and UX. -- day 3 was continued... learned styling basics and understood concept styling a indivdual class instead of every paragph on the page.

day 4: 
added another section to my html page using additional h2 headings. learned that heading strutucre content and are not limited to one use. 
practised distingushing paragraphs visually using CSS styling.
applied colour changes and emphasis to specific texts to create hierarchy. 
Key understanding: HTML Builds structure. CSS controls presentation and readablity. 
Observation: small visiual changes dramtically affect clarity and user attention. Beginning to see how layout and Heirarchy influence UX.
